        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            PDFxTMD is a novel library designed for parton distribution functions (PDFs) that integrates both collinear PDFs (cPDFs) and transverse momentum-dependent PDFs (TMDs). It aims to provide a unified and efficient framework for PDF computations, enhancing the toolkit available to the high-energy physics community.
